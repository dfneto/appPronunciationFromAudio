driving 70 miles per hour Southbound on Highway 99 we left the restaurant and our friends behind it was just the two of us now my girlfriend tired from the evening's event was dozing in the passenger seat not me I was wide awake eyes glued to the road in front waving my finger in the air like a baton as I quietly conducted The Melodies of Tchaikovsky
 still in a state of euphoria
